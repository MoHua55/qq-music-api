/**
 * The `sealed` backend for the `SessionResolver` port.
 *
 * Three things make it behave differently from `stored`, and all are deliberate:
 *
 * - `revoke()` is a no-op. There is no server-side record to delete, so a sealed token stays
 *   usable until it expires and logout means the client discarding it. A denylist would reintroduce
 *   exactly the shared mutable state this mode exists to avoid; the exposure is bounded by the
 *   session lifetime instead.
 * - The credential is reduced to an allowlist before it is sealed. Whatever new fields upstream
 *   starts returning, they do not silently become part of a token that travels through clients.
 * - Renewal hands out a new token (`rotate`), and only when the client asks for it through
 *   `POST /login/refresh`. Measured in 2026-10: after a refresh the old musickey kept working for at
 *   least ten minutes on both QQ and WeChat, so the old token is left to expire on its own and a
 *   client that fails to store the new one simply renews again next time.
